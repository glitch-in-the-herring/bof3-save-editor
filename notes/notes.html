            It seems that I have to revise a lot of my prior assumptions. I initially thought that<br/>
            Accession is an ability unusable to every party member save Ryu, because I remembered<br/>
            that Accession crashed the game when I gave it to Nina. For some reason, it seems to<br/>
            "work" now. It doesn't crash the game anymore but it does have visual glitches. Sometimes.<br/>
            <br/>
            Kaiser (palette swap), Tiamat, Behemoth, and Mammoth (party members fused) all work well<br/>
            without any significant visual glitches. With Kaiser, the palette swap doesn't<br/>
            happen. Other dragon forms have some sort of visual glitch when using them.<br/>
            <br/>
            The only character besides Ryu who has a custom animation when using a transformation<br/>
            spell is Rei, and his Weretiger transformation animation is what's being used when he<br/>
            uses Accession.<br/>
