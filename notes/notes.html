            It seems that I have to revise a lot of my prior assumptions. I initially thought that<br/>
            Accession is an ability unusable to every party member save Ryu, because I remembered<br/>
            that Accession crashed the game when I gave it to Nina. For some reason, it seems to<br/>
            "work" now. It doesn't crash the game anymore but it does have visual glitches.<br/>
