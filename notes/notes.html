        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <h2>2021/11/02 - 2021/11/??: On Accession</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Emulators used: PCSX-Redux, RetroArch (PCSX-ReARMed core), RetroArch (Duckstation core)</i><br/>
            Accession is an ability normally only accessible to Ryu. It lets him transform into<br/>
            a dragon. However, it turns out that other characters can also use Accession, with a few<br/>
            catches:

            <h3>Usability</h3>
            <p>Certain dragon forms don't work on certain emulators. PCSX-ReARMed seems to crash with most dragon<br/>
                forms, except for Kaiser (needs more testing). DuckStation and PCSX-Redux will not crash with all<br/>
                dragon forms (needs more testing). However, there will be plenty of graphical glitches, such as the sprite<br/>
                not rendering properly, or Ryu's sprite being changed into the dragon's sprite, even when he hasn't used<br/>
                Accession.
            </p>

            <h3>Precedence</h3>
            <p>Two or more characters can use Accession in the same turn, but not using the PCSX-ReARMed core.<br/>
               If there are two or more characters using Accession, then the dragon forms they transform into depends<br/>
               on whoever uses Accession last. For example, if Rei's turn is first, and he uses Accession to transform into<br/>
               a Whelp, but on the same turn, Momo uses Accession to transform into a Kaiser dragon, then both Rei and Momo<br/>
               will become Kaiser dragons.
            </p>

            I have yet to test this on my SCPH-9002, as I don't have a Dexdrive utility to copy memory card<br/>
            files to my Playstation 1 memory card. The closest I can get to real hardware is with DuckStation<br/>
            and it seems that 
        </p>

            <h3>Animations and Sounds</h3>
            <p>Post-timeskip Rei gains the Weretiger ability, giving him animation frames for transformation<br/>
                abilities. The Weretiger transformation animation is the animation Rei uses when he uses the<br/>
                Accession ability. For a few frames, you can see the Weretiger before the black sphere effect.<br/>
