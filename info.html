        <h1>Breath of Fire III Save Editor</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This tool allows you to edit Breath of Fire III save files inside a PS1 memory card file.</p>
        <h2>Info</h2>
        <p>There are some important things to know when using this tool: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>This tool accepts most memory card formats used by emulators (.mcd, .mcr, etc).</li>
            <li>This tool does not permanently store a copy of your memory card file.</li>
            <li>Stats are clipped if they exceed the byte range. For example, giving a character 1000 PWR works,<br/>
                but trying to give a character 100000 PWR will not work, as that exceeds the 16-bit unsigned integer<br/>
                limit, which is 65535.</li>
            <li>Current HP/AP is the amount of HP/AP the character currently has. Current max HP/AP is the current maximum<br/>
                HP/AP the character can have. Current max HP is affected when a character dies mid-battle and is not<br/>
                revived, using certain healing items, and not drinking in the Desert of Death. Current max AP is not<br/>
                affected by anything to my knowledge. True max HP/AP is the value which the current HP/AP will recover to<br/>
                after being afflicted by a non-permanent change, such as the ones mentioned above affecting current max HP.<br/>
                Levelling up and using life/magic shards are the only way to increase true maximum HP/AP.</li>
            <li>Yes, you can equip the LifeArmor as a shield on Nina, which you can't normally do on a non-hacked game.<br/>
                No, I won't stop you from doing that, because the game clearly allows that to work.<br/>
                Yes, there are issues with this. For example, with the LifeArmor equipped on Nina as a shield, it will not<br/>
                regenerate any HP in battle, but it will when walking. I won't list every issue by using mismatched equipment<br/>
                so go ahead and try it yourself.</li>
            <li>Yes, you can have two stacks of healing herb in the OPTIONS inventory. I'm not going to prevent you from doing that.</li>
            <li>I will, however, give you some more warnings. Certain skills will not work with certain characters. Accession does <br/>
                not work with any party member except Ryu, and Weretiger only works with Rei. It won't break your save file immediately<br/>
                but if you decided to use these abilities, then the game will crash.</li>
