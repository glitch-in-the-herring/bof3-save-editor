        <p>
            This tool allows you to edit Breath of Fire III save files inside a PS1 memory card file. <br/>
            Special credits to ZC_Liu from GameFAQs for his <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/196817-breath-of-fire-iii/faqs/30733">Breath of Fire III Secrets FAQ</a>, which helped a lot with finding the hidden stats,<br/>
            and to LBokhsa for <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/196817-breath-of-fire-iii/49798331#6">his post</a> in GameFAQ's Breath of Fire III board for pointing out the save file's checksum.</p>
            Some information from the instructions were adapted from ZC_Liu's guide.

        <ol>
            <li><b>Character picker</b>. Switches between each character in your party which you want to edit.</li>
            <li><b>Stats editor</b>. Most of the inputs here should be self-explanatory. However the terms
            current, true, base, and fatigue might need a bit of explanation:
            <ul>
                <li><i>Current HP/AP</i> is the amount of HP/AP the character has currently</li>
                <li>
                    <i>Current max HP/AP</i> is the maximum cap of HP/AP the character can have currently.<br/>
                    Current max HP decreases when the character is KO'd mid-battle and is not revived, <br/>
                    Mandrake is used to heal the character, forgetting to drink water in the<br/>
                    Desert of Death, or using the Disembowel ability. Current max HP recovers to<br/>
                    true max HP when taking a rest anywhere but the camp. As far as I know, nothing<br/>
                    affects current max AP.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Base PWR/DEF/INT/AGL</i> is the character's PWR/DEF/INT/AGL before being modified<br/>
                    by equipment/in-battle spells and items. For example, if Ryu's base PWR is currently<br/>
                    320, equipping him with the GKS, Aries Gloves, and Titan Belt will increase his PWR by<br/>
                    180 (GKS) + 10 (Aries Gloves) + 10 (Titan Belt) = 200, thereby setting his total PWR to 520.<br/>
                    While total power is stored in the save file, the reason you can only edit the base<br/>
                    versions of these stats is because the game ignores any changes you make to the total<br/>
                    stats if they don't match the total calculations.<br/>
                    Using the previous example, if I were to set Ryu's total PWR to 650 in the save file, the<br/>
                    game will calculate Ryu's total power from his Base PWR + any modifiers from his equipment<br/>
                    and set that as his base PWR instead. So it's no use to change the total PWR.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Fatigue</i> the term ZC_Liu uses to describe this stat, as there isn't any official<br/>
                    term for this stat. It determines how much a character's current max HP is reduced after<br/>
                    being KO'd mid-battle and not revived, using Mandrake, forgetting to drink in the<br/>
                    Desert of Death, or using the Disembowel ability.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Stats have internal limitations built in them to prevent overflow. For example, trying to set the<br/>
            level above 255 will cause the editor to treat it as 255. In this case, level is a single-byte stat,<br/>
            and so the largest value it can theoretically have is 255.</li>
            <li><b>Resistances</b>. Resistances determine how strong a character is against a certain element.<br/>
            Fire, Ice, Electric, Earth, anad Wind resistance behave like so:<br/>

            <li><b>Equipment</b>. Game-restricted limitations can be bypassed here. For example, it is possible<br/>
            to equip Nina with a LifeArmor as a shield. Do note that there are some equipments which do not<br/>
            work properly when equipped "illegally", such as the LifeArmor not recovering HP during battle<br/>
            when equipped as anything but armor.</li>
            <li><b>Abilities</b>. Use the [&lt;] and [&gt;] buttons to navigate between the ability pages. Be wary when adding<br/>
            certain abilities. Notably, the ability "Paralyze" crashes the game when used (which makes "Paralyze" a fitting name).</li>
            <li><b>Stat Growth Modifier</b>. When a character is apprenticed under a master, their stat growth will be <br/>
            modified according to who their master is. Apprenticing level is the level which the character starts<br/>
            apprenticing under that master. This is used by the game to calculate when certain skills/items/formations<br/>
            are unlocked. A master can only be selected if the master has been unlocked. See the section below about<br/>
            inventory on how to unlock masters.</li>

                inventory page.<br/>
                For example, in the screenshot, the 3rd slot of the "Item" inventory page contains one Spearfish (ID = 75).

                    Although it will not immediately crash the game, a party without Ryu is very glitchy and has the potential<br/>
                    to break the game.
                    <ol>
                        <li>The character replacing Ryu will not have their sprite rendered properly</li>
                        <li>If the character has a field action, using it will crash the game</li>
                        <li>Battles will either never load, or will be extremely glitched.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Battles will sometimes load, but the graphics will be extremely glitched. It's kind of a roulette,<br/>
                    some days you might get something that completely doesn't work, and some other you'll get a bare<br/>
                    minimum working.

                    ... <b>add Teepo back to the party after he becomes permanently unavailable.</b> This has more or less the same effects<br/>
                    as removing Ryu from your party. His sprite will be messed up (if you can call it messed up), his field<br/>
                    actions will crash the game, and battles will be glitched. There might be a way to add him back to<br/>
                    your party, as I remember seeing a GameShark code to return Teepo to your party a really long time ago.<br/>
                    However, I am unable to find this code, and as of writing this page, it is still impossible to add<br/>
                    Teepo back without screwing something up really horribly.<br/>
                    I also read on GameFAQs (<a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/196817-breath-of-fire-iii/52546331#3" class="spoiler-link">source</a>) that you can use Teepo with a party of Child Ryu and<br/>
                    Rei. I am unable to confirm this with my own attempt, which resulted in the same glitch as replacing any other party<br/>
                    member with Teepo.

                <li>... <b>set the first slot to blank</b></li>

            You might be able to: <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>Have multiple slots filled with the same character</li>

        <h2><span id="examples">Legitimate Use Cases</span></h2>
        <p>
            Besides the obvious use cases of <i>cheating your way out of a difficult boss battle</i> or <i>getting a rare item drop</i>, there<br/>
            are much better use cases of this save editor, and I've compiled a few ways you can make your save file more interesting.<br/>
        </p>
        <h3>Solo Straight Character Challenge</h3>
        <p>
            Before reading this, read the warnings in the instructions for the party members editor.<br/>
            In a Solo Straight Character Challenge (SSCC) run, you can only use one character, with a few exceptions where your party member selection is<br/>
            limited during certain sections of the game. Normally, you'd have three in-battle party members, and that makes solo runs a bit tricky.<br/>
            However, with this editor you can disable the other two in-battle party members, leaving your main character alone to fight the battles<br/>
            You will have to change your in-battle party members when that character becomes unavailable though.<br/>
            To add a bit of variation, why not do a duo challenge, where you can only use two characters with exceptions where one of them (or both)<br/>
            is not accessible.
        </p>

        <h3>No Transformation</h3>
        <p>
            Can't resist using Accession? Can't resist the power of the Myrmidon? Then just remove Accession from Ryu, and never become a dragon ever<br/>
            again. You can also one-up the challenge by removing Weretiger from Rei.<br/>
        </p>

        <h3>No Level Up</h3>
        <p>
            After you feel like your party's stats are enough, set everyone's level to 99 and EXP to 4,000,000. Now you can't level up,<br/>
            you can't get skills/items/formations from masters, you can't get new abilities from levelling up, and you can't get stat increases<br/>
            from levelling up.
        </p>

        <h3>Custom Character Builds</h3>
        <p>
            Do you want Nina to be able to use her physical attacks more often? Do you want to make Ryu an offensive spellcaster?<br/>
            Do you want Garr to be an assist caster? You can do these by changing the character's stat gains modifier, and also their skills.<br/>
            For example, say you want a mage/spellcaster Ryu. You can try increasing his INT and AP growth, while setting his power and defense<br/>
            growth to a negative value. You can also give him some elemental spells, and optionally remove his healing spells.<br/>
            Do remember that this is only a save editing utility. You can't change the power of a spell, and you can't change<br/>
            what abilities a character receives when they level up. You also have to change the stat growth modifiers again if you<br/>
            decide to apprentice under a new master.
        </p>
