        <h1>Breath of Fire III Save Editor</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This tool allows you to edit Breath of Fire III save files inside a PS1 memory card file.</p>
        <h2>Info</h2>
        <p>There are some important things to know when using this tool: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>This tool accepts most memory card formats used by emulators (.mcd, .mcr, etc).</li>
            <li>This tool does not permanently store a copy of your memory card file.</li>
            <li>Stats are clipped if they exceed the byte range. For example, giving a character 1000 PWR works,<br/>
                but trying to give a character 100000 PWR will not work, as that exceeds the 16-bit unsigned integer<br/>
                limit, which is 65535.</li>
            <li>Current HP/AP is the amount of HP/AP the character currently has. Current max HP/AP is the current maximum<br/>
                HP/AP the character can have. Current max HP is affected when a character dies mid-battle and is not<br/>
                revived, using certain healing items, and not drinking in the Desert of Death. Current max AP is not<br/>
                affected by anything to my knowledge. True max HP/AP is the value which the current HP/AP will recover to<br/>
                after being afflicted by a non-permanent change, such as the ones mentioned above affecting current max HP.<br/>
                Levelling up and using life/magic shards are the only way to increase true maximum HP/AP.</li>
            <li>A "base" stat is a stat before it is modified by other factors, such as equipment. The reason why I'm showing<br/>
                base stats instead of "net" stat is because the game will automatically override net stats calculations, which<br/>
                makes that kinda useless in the save file? I think? For example, if Ryu's base PWR is 250 and is equipped with the<br/>
                GooKingSword (180 PWR), and assuming nothing else is modifying his power at the moment, his net PWR will be 250 + 180,<br/>
                or 430. The values "250" and "430" appear in the save data, but trying to change "430" will be useless, since the game<br/>
                will recalculate that upon loading the save file.</li>
            <li>This editor allows limitations in the game regarding equipability to be bypassed. For example, you can <br/>
                equip a LifeArmor as a shield on Nina, or give the KaiserBreath ability to Rei. However, there may be glitches<br/>
                especially with the skills, so watch out for that</li>
            <li><b>When using the party member, if you do not have access to a party member (eg. Teepo after an event, adult Ryu before an event)<br/>
                   you cannot add them to your party. It will break the game.</b></li>
