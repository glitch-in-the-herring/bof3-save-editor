        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            This tool allows you to edit Breath of Fire III save files inside a PS1 memory card file. <br/>
            Special credits to ZC_Liu from GameFAQs for his <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/196817-breath-of-fire-iii/faqs/30733">Breath of Fire III Secrets FAQ</a>, which helped a lot with finding the hidden stats.<br/>
            Some information from the instructions were adapted from his guide.

        <h3>Characters</h3>
        <img src="img/info/character.png" width="500" alt="character editor interface">
        <ol>
            <li><b>Character picker</b>. Switches between each character in your party which you want to edit.</li>
            <li><b>Stats editor</b>. Most of the inputs here should be self-explanatory. However the terms
            current, true, base, and fatigue might need a bit of explanation:
            <ul>
                <li><i>Current HP/AP</i> is the amount of HP/AP the character has currently</li>
                <li>
                    <i>Current max HP/AP</i> is the maximum cap of HP/AP the character can have currently.<br/>
                    Current max HP decreases when the character is KO'd mid-battle and is not revived, <br/>
                    Mandrake is used to heal the character, forgetting to drink water in the<br/>
                    Desert of Death, or using the Disembowel ability. Current max HP recovers to<br/>
                    true max HP when taking a rest anywhere but the camp. As far as I know, nothing<br/>
                    affects current max AP.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Base PWR/DEF/INT/AGL</i> is the character's PWR/DEF/INT/AGL before being modified<br/>
                    by equipment/in-battle spells and items. For example, if Ryu's base PWR is currently<br/>
                    320, equipping him with the GKS, Aries Gloves, and Titan Belt will increase his PWR by<br/>
                    180 (GKS) + 10 (Aries Gloves) + 10 (Titan Belt) = 200, thereby setting his total PWR to 520.<br/>
                    While total power is stored in the save file, the reason you can only edit the base<br/>
                    versions of these stats is because the game ignores any changes you make to the total<br/>
                    stats if they don't match the total calculations.<br/>
                    Using the previous example, if I were to set Ryu's total PWR to 650 in the save file, the<br/>
                    game will calculate Ryu's total power from his Base PWR + any modifiers from his equipment<br/>
                    and set that as his base PWR instead. So it's no use to change the total PWR.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Fatigue</i> the term ZC_Liu uses to describe this stat, as there isn't any official<br/>
                    term for this stat. It determines how much a character's current max HP is reduced after<br/>
                    being KO'd mid-battle and not revived, using Mandrake, forgetting to drink in the<br/>
                    Desert of Death, or using the Disembowel ability.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Stats have internal limitations built in them to prevent overflow. For example, trying to set the<br/>
            level above 255 will cause the editor to treat it as 255. In this case, level is a single-byte stat,<br/>
            and so the largest value it can theoretically have is 255.</li>
            <li><b>Resistances</b>. Resistances determine how strong a character is against a certain element.<br/>
            Fire, Ice, Electric, Earth, anad Wind resistance behave like so:<br/>

            <li>Equipment. Game-restricted limitations can be bypassed here. For example, it is possible<br/>
            to equip Nina with a LifeArmor as a shield. Do note that there are some equipments which do not<br/>
            work properly when equipped "illegally", such as the LifeArmor not recovering HP during battle<br/>
            when equipped as anything but armor.</li>
            <li>Abilities. Use the [&lt;] and [&gt;] buttons to navigate between the ability pages. Be wary when adding<br/>
            certain abilities to a character. For example, Accession will never work properly on anyone but<br/>
            Ryu, and the ability "Paralyze" crashes the game when used (which makes "Paralyze" a fitting name).</li>
            <li>Stat Growth Modifier. When a character is apprenticed under a master, their stat growth will be <br/>
            modified according to who their master is. Apprenticing level is the level which the character starts<br/>
            apprenticing under that master. This is used by the game to calculate when certain skills/items/formations<br/>
            are unlocked. A master can only be selected if the master has been unlocked. See the section below about<br/>
            inventory on how to unlock masters.</li>
